            The end goal was to develop an anatomical model of a speech or hearing related structure. 
            While creating an analog model moulded from plasticine would have sufficed, I challenged myself to craft a digital 3D model using Blender, an open source 3D modelling software.
            Before undertaking this project, I had explored 3D modeling out of personal interest, driven by curiosity and a desire to learn. I was enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply and challenge my skills in a more substantial manner through this project.

            Towards the end, while exploring different ways to present the model, I decided to push my ambition just a little further by implementing Augmented Reality. 
            After some research and trial, I managed to make it such that my model could be viewed in AR.
